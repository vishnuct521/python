# lambda function

# lambda functions is  best used in a situation where you need a small one off function for a short period of time
#
# especially when you don't want to define a full fledged function using the def key word
#
# passing functions as arguments simple transformation anonimous function and callback function
#
# lambda function are not suitable for comblex logic or large block of code

# # * 1st-program
# add = lambda x,y : x+y
# result = add(20,35)
# print(result)



# # * 2nd-program
# def classroom(n):
#  square = lambda x,n : n+x # if you give n here don't give to the class room n
#  return square
# demo = classroom(20)
# print(demo(30))


# # * 3rd-program
# def classroom(n):
#  square = lambda x : n+x
#  return square
# demo = classroom(20)
# print(demo(30))


# # * 4th-program
# def multilier(n):
#     multiply_by = lambda x : x*n
#     return multiply_by
# multiply_by = multilier(5)
# print(multiply_by(10))
# print(multiply_by(7))
