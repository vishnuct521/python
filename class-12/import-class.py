# how import modules

# first we need a module
# step - 1
# so we can create a module like create a folder first in desktop and give name capital M and small ain = Main
#
# step - 2
# inside one folder and two files
# foldeName = capital 'SUB'
# first_file_Name = __init__.py :- that should be empty file
# second_file_Name = mainpgm.py :- all small letters Here also we should create a function
# function
# def Mainpgm():
#     print("this is mainpgm")
#
# step - 3
# we already created 'SUB' folder inside that folder we should create two files
#
# first_file_Name = __init__.py this should be empty
# second_file_Name = subpgm.py :- Here we should create a function to understanding purpose we are creating the function
# function
# def subpgm():
#     print("this is subpgm")
# this is the creation of an example module
#
# step - 4
# After that in your python file you can import the already created Main module
# * in your module you should type in the top
#
# from Main import mainpgm
# from Main.subfolder import subpgm
# mainpgm.Mainpgm()
# subpgm.subpgm()
#
# and the created module will import into your module
# how we can know imported or not :- if the Main module's function output  will display on your module

# using cmd i missed that
